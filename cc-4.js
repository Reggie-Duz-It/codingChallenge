//EASY: Write a function that would allow you to do this:

var run = function (running) {
    var running = "running";
    return `Today's excercise: ${running}`
}

var swim = function (swimming) {
    var swimming = "swimming";
    return `Today's excercise: ${swimming}`
}

console.log(run());
console.log(swim());
